I love to teach, I enjoy the synergistic relationship between teacher and student. The experience is challenging and rewarding and I believe I really do have the heart of a teacher. In 2006 I received a BFA from the Ernest Welch School of Art and Design at Georgia State University. While in Atlanta I was able to work with Turner Studios, CNN International, and CNN Espa√±ol. I moved back to Florida to pursue my family life where I married my husband Erik, a musician, music producer, label owner, and sound designer/engineer. In 2012 I received a Masters Degree in Fine Art specializing in Media Design from Full Sail University. Throughout pursuing my education, teaching career, and my growing family, I have always maintained my freelance career, when the opportunity is right and I feel a true connection with a client I can't say no to the work. It's in my blood and it's who I am!"
